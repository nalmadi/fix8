# Fix8 Overview

Fix8 (Fixate) is an Open-Source GUI Tool for Working with Eye Tracking Data in Reading Tasks. FIx8 includes a novel semi-automated correction approach for eye tracking data in reading tasks.  The proposed approach allows the user to collaborate with an algorithm to produce accurate corrections in less time without sacrificing accuracy.

# Main Features ‚≠ê

- Drift correction including manual, assisted (semi-automated), and automated correction.
- Fully customizable and interactive visualization.
- Synthetic data and distortion generation including full control of word skipping, within-line and between-line regressions.
- Filters: high-pass, low-pass, outlier, merge, and outside screen filters.
- Analyses including hit-test and eye movement metrics like First-Fixation Duration, Single-Fixation Duration, and Total Time.
- Data Converters: EyeLink data, ASCII, CSV, and JSON are supported.

# Run Fix8 from code üöÄ
To run Fix8 from the Python code, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nalmadi/fix8.git
    cd fix8
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

    It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and isolate your project's environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv myvenv
    ```

    Activate the virtual environment:
    
    **On Windows:**
    
    ```bash
    myvenv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    **On macOS and Linux:**
    
    ```bash
    source myvenv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Requirements:**

    Once the virtual environment is activated, install the package via pip:

    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

    If you plan to make changes to the code and rerun the package with the new changes, use this command instead:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

5. **Run the Tool:**

    Once done, run the tool simply by entering the command "fix8" in the terminal:

    ```bash
    fix8
    ```


6. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment:**

    When you're done using the tool, deactivate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```



# Keyboard Shortcuts ‚å®Ô∏è‚Äã
