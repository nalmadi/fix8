# Fix8 Overview

Fix8 (Fixate) is an Open-Source GUI Tool for Working with Eye Tracking Data in Reading Tasks. FIx8 includes a novel semi-automated correction approach for eye tracking data in reading tasks.  The proposed approach allows the user to collaborate with an algorithm to produce accurate corrections in less time without sacrificing accuracy.

    ```

    **On macOS and Linux:**
    
    ```bash
    source myvenv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Requirements:**

    Once the virtual environment is activated, install the package via pip:

    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

4. **Run the Tool:**

    Once done, run the tool simply by entering the command "fix8" in the terminal:

    ```bash
    fix8
    ```
