# Fix8 Overview

Fix8 (Fixate) is an open-source GUI Tool for working with eye tracking data in reading tasks. Fix8 includes a novel semi-automated correction approach for eye tracking data in reading tasks. The proposed approach allows the user to collaborate with an algorithm to produce accurate corrections in less time without sacrificing accuracy.

    Download Windows executable here: <a id="raw-url" href="https://github.com/nalmadi/fix8/releases/download/v1.3/fix8_v1.3_Windows.zip">[Windows]</a>

    >- Unzip the downloaded file.
    >- Locate Fix8.exe and run it, first run might take a couple of minutes.
    >- Enjoy!

- Mac:

    Download Mac app here: <a id="raw-url" href="https://github.com/nalmadi/fix8/releases/download/v1.3/fix8_v1.3_Mac.dmg">[Mac App]</a>
    
    >- Right-click on `fix8` and select `open.`
    >- A message that reads `fix8.app can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software.` click on 'open' then 'run' to run Fix8.
    --
    In some cases, you might have to do the following to allow the app to run:
        1.Open System Settings.
        2. Click Privacy & Security, scroll down, and click the Open Anyway button to confirm your intent to open or install the app.
        3. When the warning prompt reappears, click 'Open'.
        4. Now, can open Fix8 in the future by double-clicking it.

# Run Fix8 from code üöÄ
To run Fix8 from the Python code, follow these steps:

## Option 1: Using Python venv
1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nalmadi/fix8.git
    cd fix8
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

    It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies and isolate your project's environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv myvenv
    ```

    Activate the virtual environment:
    
    **On Windows:**
    
    ```bash
    myvenv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    **On macOS and Linux:**
    
    ```bash
    source myvenv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install Requirements:**

    Once the virtual environment is activated, install the package via pip:

    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

    If you plan to make changes to the code and rerun the package with the new changes, use this command instead:

   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

5. **Run the Tool:**

    Once done, run the tool simply by entering the command "fix8" in the terminal:

    ```bash
    fix8
    ```


6. **Deactivate the Virtual Environment:**

    When you're done using the tool, deactivate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```

## Option 2: Using conda Environment
1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nalmadi/fix8.git
    cd fix8
    ```

2. **Create and Activate conda Environment:**

    It's recommended to use a conda environment to manage dependencies and ensure compatibility:

    ```bash
    conda create -n fix8env python=3.11
    conda activate fix8env
    ```

3. **Install Requirements:**

    Once the conda environment is activated, install the package via pip:

    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

    If you plan to make changes to the code and rerun the package with the new changes, use this command instead:

    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

4. **Run the Tool:**

    Once done, run the tool simply by entering the command "fix8" in the terminal:

    ```bash
    fix8
    ```

5. **Deactivate the Environment:**

    When you're done using the tool, deactivate the conda environment:

    ```bash
    conda deactivate
    ```


# Python Compatibility üêç
Fix8 has been thoroughly tested and runs reliably on Python versions 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11. Support for Python 3.12 and 3.13 is in progress, please checkout the  <a id="raw-url" href="https://github.com/nalmadi/fix8/tree/py313-updates">`[py313-updates]`</a> branch of this repository for the latest Python 3.13 compatible version of Fix8.
